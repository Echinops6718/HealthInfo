Provides broad neuroprotective effects. Reduces inflammation, cancer risk, Alzheimer's risk, Parkinson's risk, retinal injury and disease risk, pulmonary hypertension risk, and ionizing radiation induced DNA damage.

Reduces sequela of kidney and liver injuries, dissolves kidney stones, and may regenerate kidney filtration capability even in advanced kidney disease.

May improve blood circulation, as well as improving prevention and treatment of strokes and resulting brain ischemia.

Likely improves bone and collagen strength.

Likely improves GI epithelial barrier integrity and [[Microbiome]] health.

Antibacterial and antiviral, and may protect against [[COVID]] infection and injuries.

Should likely be avoided if taking pharmaceutical blood thinners or blood pressure medication due to risk of potentiating effects.
