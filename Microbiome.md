Evidence based medicine is in the midst of redefining aspects of physiology and causes of health and illness through recent breakthroughs in microbiome research. This offers significant new windows into treatments and possible resolutions for many diseases that have been historically considered incurable, though also opens the possibility that many disease states historically considered non-contagious, like cancers and autoimmunity, may be communicable through transmission of altered/impaired microbiomes.

Eyes have a distinct microbiome from the rest of the body that is influenced by oral health, the health of the GI microbiome, and even wearing contact lenses. The eye microbiome changes in measurably predictable ways when contending with various states of disease, such as glaucoma or macular degeneration:

Apples have a complete symbiotic microbiome unto themselves, which appears to be mostly concentrated in their skin and core. Organic apples have a more robust and diverse microbiome than conventional, which protects from E. Coli and other pathogens, as well as likely having increased benefit for the health and diversity of the human microbiome:

Glyphosate (Roundup) and dicamba damage the GI microbiome through their herbicidal/antibiotic effects, and increase the likelihood of cancers and many forms of autoimmune and chronic inflammatory illnesses. Avoid plant or animal based foods/products grown with, or consuming, these forms of herbicides. In North America, this would require only ingesting/wearing organic plant and animal products:

Oxytocin not only increases social bonding with in-groups, but also improves immune system response and wound healing, though likely increases social intolerance of out-groups. Ingesting probiotics containing Lactobacillus reuteri (ATCC 6475) likely upregulates endogenous oxytocin, with all of the associated benefits, though caution may be necessary to minimize downsides:

Antibiotic use is likely a significant risk factor in developing multiple sclerosis, with growing evidence for the disease process occurring through GI microbiome disruption. Repairing microbiome health and diversity looks promising as a treatment, and possible cure for MS:

Antibiotics damage the microbiome in potentially non-reversible ways that increase lifetime risk of cancers, autoimmunity, and many forms of chronic inflammatory diseases. Avoid antibiotics unless absolutely necessary. Ingesting currently available probiotics during or shortly after a round of antibiotics may cause further harm.  [[Seirogan]] is likely a good alternative to antibiotics for mild to moderate food poisoning:

Type 1 diabetes may be associated with Legionella growth in inadequately heated or cooled plumbing. Children and immunocompromised people appear to be the most at risk, potentially due to lower immune system/microbiome resiliency:
