Neuroprotective and neuroregenerative. Reduces inflammation, dementia risk, Alzheimer's risk, cancer risk, Parkinson's risk, multiple sclerosis related fatigue, ALS risk, diabetes risk, and hypertension risk.

There is contradictory information between different studies regarding whether (Acetyl-)L-Carnitine promotes or protects from atherosclerosis. 

Improves mitochondrial and synaptic function.

May improve [[Microbiome]] health and gut-brain axis communication.

May improve post-stroke recovery.

Likely reduces risk of [[COVID]] induced injuries.

Dosages over 250mg per day may reduce benefits and increase side effects.
