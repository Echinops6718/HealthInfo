Profoundly neuroprotective and neuroregenerative. Reduces inflammation, cancer risk, Alzheimer's risk, multiple sclerosis risk, and DNA damage. Reduces low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and raises high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, protecting against dyslipidemia, and which may provide protection against heart attacks and strokes.

Niacin causes temporary skin flushing and sensations of warmth due to mast cells clearing histamines. Some people don't like the skin flushing sensation and appearance, and have historically substituted with [[Nicotinamide (non-flushing)]], though this loses most of the health benefits and introduces significant risks. 

There is some risk of liver damage at doses higher than 500mg per day in around 20% of people. Taking more than 500mg of niacin per day should be accompanied by periodic liver medical evaluation and testing. Niacin can also increase hyperglycemia, and at high dosage appears to confer a 5% increased risk of new onset type 2 diabetes within a few years of consistent supplementation. Reducing high glycemic food intake is recommended if supplementing.

Clinical dosage starts from 500mg and can be more than 3g per day, though benefits can usually be found at lower doses as well.

Likely synergistic in effect when combined with [[Glutamine]].

The following landmark niacin risk study doesn't differentiate between 3g, 2g, and 1g per day dosages in varying cohort groups, so all that can reasonably be concluded is that 2g or 3g per day of niacin is probably too much if eating high glycemic foods:
