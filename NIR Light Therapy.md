Improves and accelerates injury and surgery recovery. 

Improves skin, nervous system, retina, and mitochondrial health and function.

May prevent and treat [[COVID]] and induced injuries.

May prevent and treat some cancers.

May treat herpes outbreaks.

High dosage of NIR light therapy for long periods of time is likely contraindicated. The greater the intensity of NIR light exposure, the shorter the exposure time should be for optimal benefit without side effects. Ten to twenty minutes of concentrated exposure per day is likely safe to minimize side effects for most NIR light emitting devices.
