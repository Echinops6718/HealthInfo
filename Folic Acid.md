The folinic acid form may be easier on the body, especially for those with methylation challenges.

Reduces risk of stroke, gum disease, anemia, malaria symptoms, liver damage, and cancer.

Likely reduces risk of contracting [[COVID]] as well as induced injuries and mortality.

Likely synergistic in effect when combined with [[Nicotinic Acid (niacin)]].

May reduce symptoms of autism and schizophrenia.

## Risks:

Folic acid supplementation may increase diabetes risk, though concurrently taking it with [[Nicotinic Acid (niacin)]] significantly reduces that risk:
