Reduces risk of stroke, gum disease, anemia, malaria symptoms, liver damage, and cancer.

Likely reduces risk of contracting [[COVID]] as well as induced injuries and mortality.

Likely synergistic in effect when combined with [[Nicotinic Acid (niacin)]].

May reduce symptoms of autism.

## Risks:

Folic acid supplementation may increase diabetes risk, though concurrently taking it with [[Nicotinic Acid (niacin)]] significantly reduces that risk:
