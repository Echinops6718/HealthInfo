Likely neurotoxic and neurodegenerative, though not to be confused with the far more beneficial (and likely safe for most people in low to moderate doses) [[Nicotinic Acid (niacin)]]. 

Nicotinamide has historically been mislabelled as "niacin" and used to fortify grains and breads to protect against primary pellegra (a chronic degenerative condition caused by niacin deficiency), though significant risks of nicotinamide have recently been discovered. Nicotinamide requires physiologic biochemical conversion into [[Nicotinic Acid (niacin)]] to be usable in the body. The conversion process appears to likely be neurotoxic. 

Avoid supplementation and foods fortified with nicotinamide.
