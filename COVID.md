COVID appears to be a lifelong chronic inflammatory illness potentially affecting all organ systems, with similar vulnerabilities to how herpes as endemic viruses remain mostly asymptomatic after initial infection in the majority of the population until geriatric years, or becoming immunocompromised.

Multi-organ system injuries appear to be cumulative for each COVID infection regardless of whether it's symptomatic. These injuries appear to cause accelerated aging and permanent systemic damage that cumulatively increases the likelihood of hospitalization and long term disability with each subsequent infection.

SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can be found in the skull bone marrow and meninges in individuals long after COVID, potentially driving long COVID.

The risk of long term COVID symptoms is cumulative, and increases with increasing number of infections. By 3+ infections, 37.9% report long term symptoms - or about 1 in every 2.6 people:

COVID will have a long tail in public health with 1 in 4 people likely having retroviruses activated, which could take years for many of those people to fully exhibit outcomes from the disease processes (unless successfully mitigated):

#### Incubation/Contagion:

Symptoms can likely take up to 14 days to appear after an incubation period begins, then contagion can likely last up to 20 days after first symptoms (if symptomatic).
