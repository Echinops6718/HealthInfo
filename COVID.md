COVID appears to be a lifelong chronic inflammatory illness potentially affecting all organ systems, with similar vulnerabilities to how oral herpes and chickenpox remain mostly asymptomatic after initial infection in the majority of hosts until geriatric years, or becoming immunocompromised.

COVID will have a long tail in public health with 1 in 4 people likely having retroviruses activated, which could take some years for many of those people to fully exhibit outcomes from the disease process (unless successfully mitigated):

#### Fomites (surface contagion):

#### Incubation/Contagion:

Symptoms can likely take up to 14 days to appear after an incubation period begins, then contagion can likely last up to 20 days after first symptoms (if symptomatic).
